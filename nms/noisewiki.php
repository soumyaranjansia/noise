    <h1 class="text-center p-4 fst-italic">"Silence! Silence!"</h1>
    <p>
        There are, admittedly, fractions of moments that strike every urbanite
        when they wish they were judges pounding a gavel resentfully and
        claiming back the golden silence of their own from the hustle and bustle
        of urban life.
    </p>

    <p>
        And the bogey of noise is not exclusive to our times. “In a thousand
        senses, I proclaim the indispensable worth of Silence, our only safe
        dwelling-place ­often”. So wrote Thomas Carlyle, a Scottish historian,
        in a letter to his friend in 1840 - when all the mechanical monsters
        condemned as noise sources were still beyond imagination.

                    Noise is often defined as the sound that is unwanted, disturbing,
                    annoying, and even detrimental to health when it is excessive and
                    becomes noise pollution. Intrinsic to the modern soundscape, noise
                    is everywhere, yet in many cases nowhere to be solved.
                </p>

                <p>
                    According to the United Nation, noise pollution is regarded as “an
                    increasingly omnipresent, yet underestimated, form of pollution”.
                    A report by World Health Organization in 2011 shows that at least
                    one million healthy life years are lost every year from
                    traffic-related noises in Western Europe.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As in China, an increasing emphasis on noise pollution has been
                    witnessed in recent decades, in tandem with its ambitious plan of
                    urbanization, the astounding economic development and the
                    overwhelming number of population.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Chinese Ministry of Environmental Protection has published
                    annual reports on environmental noise prevention and control since
                    2011, demonstrating the situation of environmental noises in China
                    with possible solutions proposed.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Thumbing through the reports from 2011 to 2017, one may soon
                    realize the danger of the background grumble of our daily life and
                    how noise is more than a nuisance. To begin with, there is
                    something about noise that you need to know.

    <h1 class="text-center m-4">Common Sources of Noise and Decibel Levels</h1>
    <p class="text-center m-4">Sound is measured in decibels (dB). A whisper is about 30 dB, normal conversation is about 60 dB, and a motorcycle engine running is about 95 dB. Noise above 70 dB over a prolonged period of time may start to damage your hearing. Loud noise above 120 dB can cause immediate harm to your ears. The table below shows dB levels and how noise from everyday sources can affect your hearing.</p>
